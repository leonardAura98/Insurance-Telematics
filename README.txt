n recent years, Kenya has experienced significant population growth, leading to increased vehicular movement. Unfortunately, this has been accompanied by a rise in road accidents due to factors such as reckless driving, poor vehicle maintenance, and the operation of uninsured or uninspected vehicles. While every vehicle in Kenya is legally required to be insured, some motorists continue to operate without proper insurance or inspection. The responsibility for vehicle inspection lies with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSA), while insurance providers determine premium costs.

The insurance industry has been essential in offering quality and affordable coverage. However, some insurance companies face tough competition, leading to practices that result in insolvency and challenges in maintaining daily operations. Moreover, the rising number of road accidents necessitates a solution that both addresses the problem and ensures sustainable operations for insurers.

The Affordable Telemetry Insurance System is a web-based application designed to calculate insurance premiums dynamically. It considers risk factors such as the vehicleâ€™s operating area, monthly driving distance, driving time, driver experience, and age. The system will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and XML to ensure efficient data processing and storage. A telemetry system, integrated with a speed meter, will track vehicle location and monitor its speed for real-time updates.

The system comprises two main modules:

User Module: Allows vehicle owners to access information about their insurance coverage, monitor driving statistics, and track their vehicles.
Company Administrator Module: Enables insurance companies to manage customer data, monitor real-time vehicle information, and calculate dynamic premiums.
This system aims to address issues such as inadequate vehicle inspections, vehicle tracking for theft prevention, and terrorism risks. Additionally, it will offer more affordable and competitive premiums, ultimately benefiting both vehicle owners and insurers by making the insurance industry more profitable and cost-effective.
